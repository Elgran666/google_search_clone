<!--
    Using a flask application to
    repeat some of the html less &
    further deepen the skills from cs50x.

    Even though it hasn't been required
    in the specs of "Search",
    it also hasn't expliclty been prohibited,
    so i think it should be okay.

                    to differentiate between a normal Google search and
                    the "I'm Feeling Lucky" search, we pass additional parameters
                    normal searches use the "btnK" parameter
                    while "btnI" is for the "I'm Feeling Lucky" search
                    which redirects to the first Google result
                    for the given search term -->
